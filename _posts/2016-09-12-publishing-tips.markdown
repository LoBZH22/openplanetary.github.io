Best practice and advices making openly available scholarly publications and data:

## Preprints services / publication repositories

The use of preprints servers should be OK with **most** Planetary Science-related journals. More general infos are e.g. on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy)

### Arxiv

* [https://arxiv.org/](https://arxiv.org/)

## Open Access journals

Open Access journals welcoming Planetary (Geo)Science content include:

* [EGU Solid Earth](http://solid-earth.net)

## Planetary journal-specific recommendations

### Elsevier (Icarus / PSS / EPSL)

excerpt from [Elsevier preprint info](https://www.elsevier.com/about/company-information/policies/sharing#preprint):

_Authors can share their preprint anywhere at any time. If accepted for publication, we encourage authors to link from the preprint to their formal publication via its Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Millions of researchers have access to the formal publications on ScienceDirect, and so links will help your users to find, access, cite, and use the best available version.Authors can update their preprints on arXiv or RePEc with their accepted manuscript_

### Journal of Geophysical Research (Planets)

excerpt from [AGU publication policy](http://publications.agu.org/author-resource-center/publication-policies/dual-publication-policy/)

_AGU does allow posting of preprints and accepted papers in not-for-profit preprint servers that are designed to facilitate community engagement and discovery across the sciences_

## Useful Tools and scripts/robots

## EU H2020 specific OA info

excerpt from section 2.2.1 of [EU H2020 open access document](https://www.iprhelpdesk.eu/sites/default/files/newsdocuments/Open_Access_in_H2020.pdf)

_Open Access archives, so called repositories, may be institution-based or subject-based collections like the economics repository RePEc (Research Papersin Economics) or the physics repository, arXiv_

An interesting tool produced by [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/) is [paper-now](https://github.com/peerj/paper-now)

## Data and code repositories
