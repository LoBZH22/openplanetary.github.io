## VESPA 

[VESPA](http://www.europlanet-vespa.eu) (Virtual European Solar and Planetary 
Access) is proposing a unified interface to search for solar system data 
resources. It is using the Virtual Observatory (VO) infrastructure developed by 
the astronomical VO: the International Virtual Observatory Alliance 
([IVOA](http://ivoa.net)). VESPA is proposing a consistent and comprehensive 
set of methods to distribute and search for data resources. 

A new version of the [main VESPA query portal](http://vespa.obspm.fr) has 
recently been released. It provides direct access to all connected databases 
and the possibility to retrieve data files based on location, time, observing 
conditions, viewing geometry, etc. It also allows the user to easily examine 
and possibly analyze most data on-line with Virtual Observatory tools.

Currently 25 database are connected, covering all fields of Planetary Science, 
including surfaces, atmospheres, plasma, small bodies, exoplanets, etc, from a 
distributed network of data providers in 4 different European countries and Japan.

Some well attended services can be accessed this way, e.g., the Encyclopedia of 
Exoplanets in Paris Observatory (~ 250,000 visits in 2016). Two other data 
services selected during the 2016 VESPA call are being connected and will be 
available in the coming weeks (from Granada and Kharkiv). In addition, one 
service from a network of amateur observers (RadioJove) has been installed. 

The number of data services available will rapidly grow in the coming year, as 
the VESPA Data Access Protocol (EPN-TAP v.2) has been adopted by ESA to provide 
access to its Planetary Science Archive, and is being studied by NASA and other 
space agencies. This system is also open to contributions from research teams. 
Teams which need support to implement their data service can apply to the 2017 
VESPA call next December. Selected teams will be invited to a 4 days workshop 
in Graz next March. 

The [SSHADE](https://blog.sshade.eu) activity is also proceeding towards a large 
public spectroscopy service. The database is being filled with laboratory 
measurements, and will be connected to the VESPA search interface later this 
year after validation.

Alternative access to VESPA-compliant data services is possible from VO tools 
such as [3Dview](http://3dview.cdpp.eu) and [CASSIS](http://cassis.irap.omp.eu), 
and an [EpnTAPClient java library](https://gitlab.irap.omp.eu/OV-GSO-DC/EpnTAPClient/tree/master) is available for developers.
